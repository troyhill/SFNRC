The `SFNRC` R package supports integration and analysis of water quality and hydrology data in south Florida. The package provides an API for the South Florida Water Management District's DBHYDRO database. For users connected to the South Florida Natural Resources Center's servers, the package also provides direct access to DataForEver data.


## Install the package

Install the SFNRC R package from GitHub using the `remotes` package (may require separate installation):

```r
if (!('remotes' %in% installed.packages())) {install.packages('remotes')}

remotes::install_github("troyhill/SFNRC", ref = 'master')

library(SFNRC)
```

### Tips

Installing this package from out-dated versions of R (NPS users) will cause an error. To change this behavior, adjust the `R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS` system variable before installation.

```r 
Sys.setenv(R_REMOTES_NO_ERRORS_FROM_WARNINGS="true")
```

To installing the package from a zip file, [download a zip file from GitHub](https://github.com/troyhill/SFNRC/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and use devtools::install_local: 

```r
if (!('devtools' %in% installed.packages())) {install.packages('devtools')}

devtools::install_local('path/to/zipfile.zip')

library(SFNRC)
```
