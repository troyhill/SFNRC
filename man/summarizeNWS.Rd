\title{Function summarizes National Weather Service precipitation geotiff files by polygon}
\usage{
summarizeNWS(
  tif_addresses,
  parameter = "observed",
  input_polygon,
  polygon_names = NULL,
  create_plots = FALSE,
  func = mean,
  date_correction = -1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tif_addresses}{character vector with full file names for tiff files to be summarized (including entire directory and file extension). Can be created with `list.files('C:/directory', full.names = TRUE)`.}

\item{parameter}{character element used to select the appropriate data layers. Acceptable `parameter` values include `observed`, `normal`, `departure_in`, and `departure_pct`.}

\item{input_polygon}{Spatvector with polygons used to summarize precipitation data. Load with `terra::vect`. Example polygon data: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/tiger-line-shapefile-2019-state-georgia-current-county-subdivision-state-based}

\item{polygon_names}{character. Name of column in `input_polygon` containing feature names/IDs. If left as `NULL`, features are numbered by their row in the polygon object.}

\item{create_plots}{logical. Optional visualization produced for each layer. Setting this to `TRUE` will dramatically slow down the run time.}

\item{func}{function. Used to summarize the monthly data from each polygon.}

\item{date_correction}{numeric. Optional correction for data date. For example, setting this to `-1` could be appropriate for a layer dated February 1st that captures January's monthly precipitation totals. If no correction is desired, set to 0.}
}
\value{
list \code{summarizeNWS} containing (1) `summary_table`, a summary dataframe showing the result of `func` applied to monthly values for Jan-Dec. More complex operations can be performed on the raw values, and (2) `all_data`, a dataframe containing the raw values from each polygon and each layer.
}
\description{
Summarize spatial data using a polygon layer to return raw values for each date and aggregate measures by month.
